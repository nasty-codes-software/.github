### What I Do

- Web apps, sites & APIs  
- Desktop tools & modding  
- Custom solutions & infrastructure  
- Performance, clarity & control

I build things from scratch â€” with clean code, tight feedback loops, and a focus on real-world use.

---

### Philosophy

Minimal. Transparent. Maintainable.  
I don't chase trends. I solve problems.
